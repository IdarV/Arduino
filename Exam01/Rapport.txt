Rapport for Exam01

==================

I started off with trying to understand how the matrix worked. I kind of understood how the 
MAX7219  worked, so it was most important to see how the matrix worked. This was harder
than expected, since most results on Google showed that people used a chip with the LED-
Driver and the LED-matrix already on one board like this :

Then, deep down in an unknown comment section, I read that it's not dangerous to manually
connect power to one of the led's. It said that i should connect HIGH to the rows, and LOW 
to the columns, so I wrote HIGH to one and LOW to another, and started matching them 
to random pins. I also used a 220 ohm resistor on them, and no ground. 

To my luck, there it was. Row 1, column 2 suddenly shined bright red. From there, it was easy
to map the pins, and that also made me understand the matrix-datasheet. I made my own,
to better have a overview over what was what.
